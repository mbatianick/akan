            <h2>Akan Name</h2>
            <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently 
            name their children after the day of 
            the week they were born and the order 
            in which they were born. These "day 
            names" have further meanings concerning 
            the soul and character of the person. 
            Middle names have considerably more 
            variety and can refer to their birth order, 
            twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.</p>
            <p>This naming tradition is shared throughout 
                West Africa and the African diaspora. During 
                the 18thâ€“19th centuries, slaves in the Caribbean 
                from the region that is modern-day Ghana were 
                referred to as Coromantees. Many of the leaders 
                of slave rebellions had "day names" including Cuffy 
                or Kofi, Cudjoe or Kojo, and Quamina or Kwame/Kwamina.</p>
